Floorp is based on Firefox, so when contributing on code this docs can help you a lot.

### Mozilla Searchfox

[Mozilla Searchfox](https://searchfox.org/)  
[Mozilla Searchfox ESR115](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-esr115/source/)  
When you want to search Firefox codes, you can search in github.  
but to search, the GitHub is slow and unconvinient to jump to other codes.

I recommend to use Searchfox, hosted in Mozilla.  
Fast, Convinient Code Searching Service.
