#### What is DRM

DRM is copyright protection mechanism.\
When you try to play content that is with DRM, the websites check the DRM is available.\
mostly to browser, the DRM is [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com/), made by Google.

Floorp doesn't have the Widevine license.\
So in Floorp, you can't play the protected videos or musics.

#### Why Floorp doesn't have the license

To aqquire the license, Floorp Devs must pay 5000 USD at least to DRM providers.

Floorp is belonging to Ablaze, a party of Japanese Software Devs.\
This issue won't be resolved because the party is not commercial something.

#### How to play the DRM-protected content

You can use the Firefox or Chrome, etc. some major browsers that have the license.
