DRM is copyright protection mechanism. \
When you try to play content that is with DRM, the websites check the DRM is available.

Floorp doesn't have the DRM license. \
So in Floorp, you can't play the protected videos or musics.

The DRM is [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com/), made by Google.

To aqquire the license, Floorp Devs must pay 5000 USD at least to DRM providers.

Floorp is belonging to Ablaze, a party of Japanese Software Devs. \
This issue won't be resolved because the party is not commercial something.

To play DRM-protected content, You can use the major browsers like Firefox or Chrome that got the license.
